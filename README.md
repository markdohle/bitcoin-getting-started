## Virgin Uses Bitcoin for the First Time

I created a Whats App group with three friends interested in using Bitcoin. I don't know why I'm useing a github repo to document this. Lets see what happens.

The goal is to transfer money without asking for permission.
     - Control keys for financial sovereignty.
     - Move, send, spend

### Crypto Exchange

This is where you buy the Bitcoin. Don't store Bitcoin on the exchange.

I'm not going to use the Strike App. It won't work everyone in my friend group. I don't think it is available in Ireland or Costa Rica. We are going to try Coinbase to purchase Bitcoin and Muun to send Lightning transactions.

Purchase against a backdrop of [Clark Moody Bitcoin Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/) for live Bitcoin market price.

### Exchange

Coinbase: Signed up on December 16. Bought $10 worth of Bitcoin. It cost me $1. The remaining $9 is not available for 8 days. Coinbase sent me an email with a link to a game and win Bitcoin. I won 3 Bitcoin and that was available immediatly. I sent it to my Muun Wallet. It cost $0.44 to send $3 worth of Bitcoin. So far a lot of fees. $1.44 on $10 and I still haven't really done anything with the money. What's the big deal.

### Cold Wallet - Key Storage - For Gold Vault

I'll follow the instructions on this and use Trezor hardware to hold my keys. 

[Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) - ~$50 + $13 shipping. Ordered on December 16.

### Hot Wallet - Key Storage - For Spending Money

Muun App: Singed up on December 16 and made first international transfer on the 17th. Transfered $3(game winnings) from Coinbase. Received $5 Lightning transaction from friend in Ireland. Now I have some spending money. Requested Lightning address instead of BTC address because Lighting is nearly free and instant. Sent $1 to Ireland and the fee was less than a penny. Then I sent $4 and the fee was $0.05. I had to request a 2nd Lightning address for the 2nd transfer. Both transfers were instant.
